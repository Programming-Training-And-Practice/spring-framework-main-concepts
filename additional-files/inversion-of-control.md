## Inversion of Control:
* Inversion of Control - aka IoC.
* Is a technique to allow dependencies to be injected at runtime.
* Dependencies are not predetermined.





## Inversion of Control One Important Characteristic.
One important characteristic of a framework is that the methods defined by the user to tailor the framework will often 
be called from within the framework itself, rather than from the user's application code. The framework often plays the 
role of the main program in coordinating and sequencing application activity. This inversion of control gives frameworks 
the power to serve as extensible skeletons. The methods supplied by the user tailor the generic algorithms defined in
the framework for a particular application.
Ralph Johnson and Brian Foote





## IoC vs Dependency Injection:
* IoC and DI are easily confused
* DI refers much to the composition of your classes
  * ie - you compose your classes with DI in mind
* IoC is the runtime environment of your code
  * ie - Spring Frameworkâ€™s IoC container
  * Spring is in control of the injection of dependencies
